title: About
---

I am a third-year undergraduate student at Henan University, majoring in Automation. My research interests include **edge intelligence, compiler optimization, reinforcement learning for large models, and multi-modal sensor fusion**. I am passionate about building intelligent systems and have hands-on experience in both hardware and software development.

I was honored to be named the **"Star of Innovation" of 2025** by Henan University, an award given to only 20 students out of over 50,000.
