title: About
---

I am a third-year undergraduate student at Henan University, majoring in Automation. My research interests include **edge intelligence, compiler optimization, reinforcement learning for large models, and multi-modal sensor fusion**. I am passionate about building intelligent systems and have hands-on experience in both hardware and software development.

I was honored to be named the **"Star of Innovation" of 2025** by Henan University, an award given to only 20 students out of over 50,000.

## 🔬 Research Experience

**Edge-Deployed Band-Split RoPE Transformer for Ultra-Low-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio UAV Speech Enhancement**  
*First Author | Published in **Drones (JCR Q1, IF=4.8)** | Jan 2025 - Apr 2025*
- Adapted the BS-RoFormer model to design a novel lightweight model for real-time, on-device speech enhancement on UAVs.
- Achieved a 2.2dB improvement in SI-SDR over existing methods, with memory usage under 500MB and a Real-Time Factor (RTF) of 0.33.

**RACE-Align: Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Preference Alignment for Large Language Models**  
*Corresponding Author | **Preprint (arXiv)** | May 2025 - Present*
- Proposed the RACE-Align framework to improve LLM alignment using preference data enhanced with external knowledge and chain-of-thought.
- Significantly improved knowledge-based reasoning and reduced hallucination rates for the Qwen3-1.7B model.

**A Compiler Optimization Engine Based on LLMs and RL**  
*First Author | Draft Completed (Target Journal: Empirical Software Engineering) | Oct 2024 - Present*
- Built a compiler optimization framework using a 14B model trained with reinforcement learning.
